# Working with Mongoose ODM and MongoDB.

Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB, which provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model your application data. It allows you to define objects with a strongly-typed schema that is mapped to a MongoDB document. Mongoose provides a higher level of abstraction for MongoDB and includes built-in type casting, validation, business logic hooks, and query building.
